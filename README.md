# OfficeEVparkingLot-SurveyQuestions

Within the SmoothEMS met GridShield project (MOOI32005), various pilot sites for EV charging serve as living labs. One of them is an office parking lot at a.s.r. in Utrecht, the Netherlands. A survey was conducted among EV-driving employees frequenting the a.s.r. parking lot test site collecting data on, among others, battery capacity, typical charging behaviour and home-commute distance (single trip).

This repository provides an outline of the survey questions (in Dutch) and procedure. Data processing is not covered.
It does not hold any responses to the survey. The respository is purely meant to increase the transparency of the data collection process. As such, no license is added to the repository as it is purely informative.

## Timeline and response
The process of data collection went as follows:

31.10.2022 - 3.11.2022

The document for collecting the addresses is 20220913GS_survey_mailingConsent_v1.pdf.
Resulted in 162 e-mail addresses.

4.11.2022 
Researcher sends first mail to participants.
The document with information for participants is 20221104GS_survey_InfosheetConsentform_Dutch_v5.pdf.

Researcher closes survey.
After removing empty responses, a total of 89 responses corresponding to 90 EV were collected.
Out of those 90 data points, 45 provided a charging ID via which the data can be added to charging session data collected at the pilot site (transactions with charging ID, arrival time, departure time, energy charged).
